# kblast: a simple web search engine

kblast is an implementation of web search engine with its crawler forked from
Gigablast.

It is forked from the commit before "The companies ElasticSearch BV, LucidWorks
and their subsidiaries or affiliates are excluded from this license." exception
was added to the Gigablast's license. While I respect the original author's
decision, I chose Gigablast when the license was simpler than what it is as the
basis of my personal experiment.

The current codebase is extracted from Gigablast and stripped some code derived
from any project other than Gigablast in order to make the license is obvious.
As a result, kblast is currently not buildable.

The goal of the kblast project is making a search engine small enough to
self-host and simple enough to understand and hack.
